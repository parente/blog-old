    "\n",
    "[Many modern web browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-synthesis) provide a speech synthesis API for JavaScript.\n",
    "You can write and invoke a function to have your notebook speak when it finishes executing certain cells, whether \n",
    "you're running it JupyterLab (>=0.34) or classic Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def speak(text):\n",
    "    from IPython.display import Javascript as js, clear_output\n",
    "    # Escape single quotes\n",
    "    text = text.replace(\"'\", r\"\\'\")\n",
    "    display(js('''\n",

    "When I open the `demo.ipynb` notebook below and `Run All` cells, I hear the notebook speak aloud when it finishes\n",
    "executing the first and second loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add notifications at select locations in your notebook to report execution progress even while you're not\n",
    "looking at the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `%%javascript` cell magic to achieve the same net effect in Jupyter Notebook. \n",

    "    setTimeout(this.clear_output.bind(this), 0);\n",
    "}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the same code doesn't properly clear the JS from the notebook document in JupyterLab, \n",
    "and the notebook speaks immediately when opened unless you clear the cell output manually.\n",
