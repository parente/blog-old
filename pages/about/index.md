I am a [toolsmith computer scientist](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/Toolsmith-CACM.pdf) with 20+ years of experience across academia, industry, and open source. I am motivated by opportunities to help people and address social issues through the thoughtful, collaborative application of technology. I constantly hone my craft, and enjoy sharing what I learn and build with others.
