[pyttsx](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyttsx/) is a cross-platform text-to-speech package for Python. It has a simple API for producing speech, setting some basic engine properties, and getting start/stop/word callbacks. pyttsx currently supports SAPI5, NSSpeechSynthesizer, and espeak, but it can be extended to support other engines and libraries.

The project BSD licensed and hosted on ~~[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/pyttsx)~~ [GitHub](https://github.com/parente/pyttsx). PyPI tracks [downloads](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyttsx) for the latest stable version and ReadTheDocs handles the [documentation](http://pyttsx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
