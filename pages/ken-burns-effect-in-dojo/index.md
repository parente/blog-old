title: Ken Burns Effect in Dojo
date: 2009-11-30

I saw a reference to the <a href="http://www.gruppo4.com/~tobia/cross-slide.shtml">jQuery CrossSlide plug-in</a> many moons ago. For some <a href="http://docs.dojocampus.org/quickstart/Animation">dojo.anim</a> practice, I decided to implement its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_Effect">Ken Burns</a> effect in a reusable Dojo widget a few days later. The code then collected dust in my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI2NDI0MTk">Dropbox</a> until today when I finally got around to sharing it.

The BSD code for the widget is [a gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/parente/3b58ccdf99016c05071e).
