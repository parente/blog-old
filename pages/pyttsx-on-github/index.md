After many months of no activity, I've moved the [main development branch of pyttsx](https://github.com/parente/pyttsx) from Launchpad to GitHub. I originally put the code on Launchpad when I was exploring new version control systems. As I've long since settled on git and GitHub for my other projects, it was about time to move pyttsx there too.
